# MSTU 5003 Design Document (Template)

Write a design document where you explain your project. You should clearly explain the problem you're trying to solve. Be sure to describe the domain you're working with and the users you're trying to target. Remember that the point of your design document is that you can hand it off to any developer and theoretically they would be able to understand and build the program.

You'll be adding to your design document as you work towards your midterm due on **March 22, 2017**.


## Topic
Studying abroad is a hallmark moment in many undergraduate students' lives. For either one semester or an entire year, American students have the option to choose virtually anywhere in the world to study for this amount of time. One destination that is common for American students is Dublin, the Irish capital. Dublin is a small city that boasts culture, literature, art, music, and a rich history. Dublin is often, however, overshadowed by a romanticized and stereotyped Ireland. Many American students who have limited knowledge on the city view it as "party central" and have a limited mindset on its potential to be a major cosmopolitan city.

This site will dig into the richer Ireland that offers wonderful opportunities for students to explore. It will help instruct students where to go in Dublin, other areas of Dublin, teach them about Irish Literature, History, Art, and other beautiful aspects of Dublin's culture. While navigating the site, students will embark on interactive quizzes that act as assessments, an area to blog with other current students who are in the Emerald Isle, as well as look up Irish calendar events and meet ups both in Dublin and in the United States. Essentially, this site will act as a hub for students about to, currently, or have studied in Dublin.

## Problem
The problem that this site is trying to resolve is to break the narrow minds American students often have before coming to Ireland by providing them with knowledge and a guide to Dublin.

## Target Audience
The target audience for the site is a college student (18-22) who has ties to Dublin due to study abroad. This site is open to all who wish to embark on a journey to learn more about the true Ireland, who want to uncover the myths and plung into the authentic Ireland by assessing their knowledge, growing their expectations, and uncovering the beauty of Dublin.

### User Stories
**Outline 2-3 user stories. Describe how they find out, engage and come back to your site. Provide rationale.**

Structure your user stories as features, so you can actually build it to meet the users needs.

**Example**: As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

Keep these questions in mind:
- Who are you building the feature for? What type of user?
- What are you building and what will it accomplish?
- What kind of engagement and value will the feature/website bring for the user? What does it accomplish?

- **User Story 1:** Kelly: 20 and a junior at Villanova University. Kelly has been to Ireland once before and is exciting to be spending her fall semester of junior year there. Before she goes, however, she wants to learn more about its history, culture, and places to go in Dublin. While she has some sense of areas, she's hoping to learn from experts that ins and outs of Irish Studies and Dublin's larger purpose and beauty in the world.
- **User Story 2:** Saoirse: 19 is a sophomore at Fordham University. Although she comes from an Irish-American background, she has never been to Dublin before. She has not idea what neighborhoods are which, what bars are appropriate, and has limited knowledge on Irish culture. She is hoping to use this site to help her prepare for her trip in the Spring.
- **User Story 3:** Mike: 22 is a graduate student who has never been to Ireland and is excited to spend his second year of Law School there. Mike's girlfriend, Cate, suggested he take a look at this site. Mike views Ireland as the party central and Cate thinks he needs to learn more about Dublin to appreciate his time there.
- **User Story 4:** Jack: 17 is taking a gap year around Europe before going to college in Boston. He is spending three weeks in Ireland. He is hoping to use this site to gain knowledge on Dublin and help better prepare for his stay in the capital.


## Strategy

This section should describe objectives, goals and metrics.

### Site Objectives:
The site objectives are:
1. To learn about Irish History from 1916-present day
2. To learn about Dublin and surrounding areas for travel
3. To avoid being a tourist, by gaining knowledge on the best places to eat, drink, and take in the culture of Dublin
4. Learn cultural differences by studying Irish art, literature, culture, and music to avoid culture shock

### Success Metrics
*Outline how you will check that the goals for your site have been met*

Make sure your program does something to measure the consider assessments as a part of your program. Here are a couple.

* Pre assessments
Students will start with a pre-assessment where they will learn what they know about Ireland and don't know. This will consist of multiple choice questions with the goal in mind to teach users that they don't truly know Ireland yet!

* Formative assessments
There will be four units, all composed on a end of unit assessment which must be passed in order to move onto the next one

Unit 1: Ireland History and Geography
Unit 2: All Around Dublin
Unit 3: Best of Dublin
Unit 4: Art, Culture, Music
